// Create axes

// Create scale (x axis will be season (2000-2022), y axis will be 2-pointer percentage)

// Start creating line chart

// We will use HW6 as starter code, since we would like to be able to filter by team

// This also allows us to filter by different metrics which are TBD

// No tooltip since there will only be one line per team
